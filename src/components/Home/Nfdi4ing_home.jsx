                <p>NFDI4Ing Terminology Service is a repository for ontologies in the broad engineering domain. It aims to serve as a central access point to the latest ontology versions. Most of the ontologies in our service are managed in various Git repositories such as GitLab or GitHub. Only a few of them are still managed on self-hosted web servers.</p>
