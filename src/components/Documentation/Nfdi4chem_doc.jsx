            <h4>API</h4>
            <p>The Terminology Service offers an open API to query and retrieve information about terms and their relations as JSON data for the use in other services such as data repositories or electronic lab notebooks (ELN). Other services can use ontological terms and their unique identifiers to annotate data with metadata, making the (meta)data more findable and interoperable. The API is part of the TIB Central Terminology Service backend. The URL of the API is  http://service.tib.eu/ts4tib/api.</p>
            
            <p>The methodology on how to use this interface is explained in the <a href="https://service.tib.eu/ts4tib/swagger-ui.html">Swagger Documentation</a>. The underlying models can also be viewed and executed through this documentation for a deeper understanding of the API commands. </p>
