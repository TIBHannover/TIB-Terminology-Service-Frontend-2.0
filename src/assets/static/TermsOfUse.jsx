                 <p><b>(4)</b> Any renewal of loan periods shall result exclusively from the data as set forth in the loan account, which shall be considered by the user. The Library shall not be under an obligation to point out an imminent end of the loan period.</p>

                 <p><b>(4)</b> Failure to return the work following the third reminder or any such corresponding letter within the 14-day period, shall entitle the Library to</p>
               <ul>
