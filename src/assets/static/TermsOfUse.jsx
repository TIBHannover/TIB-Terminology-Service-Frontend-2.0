          <h3>1. Scope of Application</h3>
          <p>
              1.1 These Special Conditions TIB TS regulate the use of the TIB TS as well as
              the rights and obligations of Registered Users and the TIB in addition to
              the Terms of Use of TIB.
          </p>
          <p>
              1.2 TIB TS data and software are freely
              accessible to everyone.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Registration</h3>
          <p>
              2.1 TIB TS can be searched and its content can be explored and reused without
              registration.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.2 Some services, such as user profiles, Taking a Note,
              and Git-based actions require a registration (Registered Users).
          </p>
          <p>
              2.3 There is no entitlement to registration, account or profile. The TIB is
              entitled to reject registrations or terminate accounts if a violation of
              these Special Conditions TIB TS exists or is expected.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.4 When registering, users must agree to the Special Conditions TIB TS and
              the Data Protection Declaration. If these Special Conditions TIB TS are
              updated, Registered Users will be notified of the changes two weeks in
              advance by email. By subsequently continuing to use TIB TS, Registered Users
              agree to the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.5 A usage relationship is established between the TIB and the Registered
              User through registration.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.6 When registering, users are obliged to fill in mandatory fields
              truthfully and completely, to keep their data up-to-date and secret and to
              protect data from access by third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.7 Accounts may be terminated for cause by TIB. A cause can be a breach of
              the Terms of Use or these Special Conditions or a legal obligation or
              official order for TIB to block the access or any other conduct, which
              raises the suspicion that the user violates or will violate the Terms of
              Use, these Special Conditions or other legal obligations also in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
              2.8 TIB will terminate accounts at the request of the user in text form at
              any time and without undue delay. All personal data in the user profile will
              be deleted without undue delay. Content created by users remains published
              as long as the TIB does not delete this content or the user does not request
              its deletion, whereupon the TIB will anonymise this content.
          </p>
          <h3>3. TIB TS</h3>
          <p>
              3.1 Anyone can view and use TIB TS content. Registered Users can create and
              modify content.
          </p>
          <p>
              3.2 The source code is made available under the
              <a href="/TIB TS/license"> MIT License</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
              3.3 Registered Users confirm that published content does not infringe any
              third party rights (e.g. copyright, rights of performers, personality and
              publicity rights, data protection). If others are involved in the
              production, Registered Users confirm that all participants are aware of the
              content of this agreement and have given their consent.
          </p>
          <p>
              3.4 Registered Users ensure that the published content does not violate
              applicable law or offend common decency, in particular does not constitute a
              criminal offense and does not constitute an administrative offense (e.g.
              infringement of copyright, trademark law, competition law) or none have
              offensive, discriminatory, racist, pornographic or extremist content. In the
              event of a violation, Section 5 applies.
          </p>
          <p>
              3.5 If a user becomes aware of a violation of the law within the meaning of
              3.3 or 3.4 he / she is obliged to inform the TIB immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
              3.6 Registered Users will indemnify the TIB from all claims of other users
              or third parties that they assert against the TIB due to infringement of
              their rights through content published by the respective Registered User, if
              the respective user can be held responsible. The respective Registered User
              assumes the costs of an appropriate legal defense of the TIB. This does not
              apply if the Registered User is not responsible for the infringement. Users
              are obliged to provide all information necessary for the examination of the
              claims and a defense in the event of a claim against the TIB truthfully and
              completely without further delay.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Functionality of the TIB TS</h3>
          <p>
              4.1 Anyone can use the TIB TS service to view and use content without
              registration. TIB TS content can be reused freely for any purpose users see
              fit, in accordance with the CC0 License (5.2 of these Special
              Conditions TIB TS).
          </p>
          <p>
              4.2 TIB TS provides functionality that requires registration. Creating and
              editing, including deleting, existing content is reserved to Registered
              Users. Content is created and edited in accordance with the CC0 License (5.1
              of these Special Conditions TIB TS). Registered Users obtain TIB TS user
              profiles, can link their profile to ORCID, are included in provenance
              information, can be members of TIB TS Observatories and can publish TIB TS
              Comparisons with a DOI.
          </p>
          <p>
              4.3 TIB TS provides programmatic access to the content (API). Anyone can use
              the TIB TS API to access existing content. Creating and editing, including
              deleting, existing content via the TIB TS API is reserved to Registered Users.
          </p>
          <p>
              4.4 TIB TS enables DOI-based publication of TIB TS content, in particular TIB TS
              Comparisons. In doing so, metadata including creator names and, if known,
              ORCID IDs are shared with DataCite. If a Registered User publishes TIB TS
              content in this form, she or he agrees to the sharing of metadata with
              DataCite. The sharing of such data is based on user consent given as part of
              the service of DataCite e. V. and ORCID. Registered Users need to connect
              their TIB TS profile with ORCID and need to explicitly activate DOI-based
              publication of TIB TS comparisons.
          </p>
          <p>
              4.5 TIB manually curates TIB TS content, including metadata. In such
              activities, TIB also resolves personal identifiers of creators in order to
              reduce the ambiguity of personal names.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Rights and obligations of the TIB</h3>
          <p>
              5.1 TIB TS content created by Registered Users is licensed to TIB under the
              licence CC0 1.0 Universal (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication</a>).

          </p>
          <p>
              5.3 The TIB assumes no liability that the service and its content are always
              uninterrupted, unchanged and available in full, as well as being up-to-date
              and free from errors of an editorial or technical nature. No liability is
              accepted for damage caused by trusting the content of the platform or its
              use.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.4 The TIB reserves the right to change the functionality, the appearance
              and these Special Conditions TIB TS at any time. Registered Users will be
              informed of the changes two weeks in advance by email. By continuing to use
              the platform after the deadline, users agree to the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.5 The TIB is entitled to terminate its service at any time. In this case,
              the TIB reserves the right to delete the content. However, this does not
              result in an obligation to delete the content.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.6 The TIB provides scientific information in all areas of engineering as
              well as chemistry, information technology, mathematics and physics to the
              public. If content by Registered Users does not satisfy the quality criteria
              TIB generally applies to scientific information, TIB may exclude the content
              from its services without prior notice.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.7 In principle, the TIB is only liable for damage caused by intent or
              gross negligence. In case of injuries to life, body or health statutory
              provisions apply.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.8 Liability for damage from unauthorized use of password-protected logins
              by third parties is not accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.9 Insofar as liability is limited or excluded, this also applies in favor
              of executive employees (m / f), representatives (m / f) and vicarious agents
              (m / f) of the TIB.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.10 If there are concrete indications of a violation of these Special
              Conditions TIB TS, the TIB is entitled to delete content, restrict the use of
              the services or block the Registered User concerned. When choosing a
              measure, the legitimate interests of the Registered User are taken into
              account, in particular whether there are indications that the Registered
              User was not responsible for the violation.
          </p>
          <p>
              5.11 Content that contains a legal violation according to 3.3 or 3.4 may be
              blocked or deleted by the TIB.
          </p>
